How to use this Makefile.

1. Put the Makefile into the directory where your ats source code resides.

2. Make sure the environment for ats (ATSHOME) is set.
  The Makefile would check the environment. If ATSHOME not set, it will exit.

3. Simple run the following
  >> make
  or
  >> make all
  or
  >> make all TARGET=test.out

  Without specifying the TARGET, the default name for the output is a.out.
  We can also search the "modify" keyword in the Makefile to find the location
to specify the name of the output as well as the source files explicitly. Please 
refer to the comment in the Makefile for details.

4. To generate html files for ats source code, please run
  >> make html

5. To clean the project, please run
  >> make clean
  However the generated html files won't be cleaned. To remove them as well,
please run
  >> make cleanall
